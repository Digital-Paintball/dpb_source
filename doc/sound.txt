SOUND WORK WE NEED TO DO

Sounds to be relativized in volume:
[all sounds in /sounds/ directory]
[Kuja, can you do this? I think I may be pretty busy tweaking textures and maps for the demo release.]

Materials to be linked to sounds:
[if we want our prop objects to be linked to sounds, someone will have to add the line:
        "$surfaceprop" "inflatable"
or
        "$surfaceprop" "foliage" [we have several foliage impact sounds]
or whatever the object should be made of.]

Our world textures use the properties:
dirt
grass [we have our own sounds for this]
deadleaves [there are no sounds for this in HL2 - we will need to create this ourselves. It would also help if we can have a brush entity that, when walked through, makes the footsteps sound like deadleaves (for displacements [which can have only one surfaceproperty] with deadleaves patches)]
gravel
concrete [we have a few sounds called HARD]

Player sounds:
It would be sweet if we get the hopper shake sounds into the demo. There are four sets:
WALKING:
 hopper shake full [HOPPERSHAKEgentle]
 hopper shake low-balls [HOPPERSHAKE_LOWBALLSgentle]
SPRINTING:
 hopper shake full [HOPPERSHAKErough]
 hopper shake low-balls [HOPPERSHAKE_LOWBALLSrough]
If it's possible in this short amount of time, the sounds should correspond to the animation of the player's marker shaking during movement.
They must not play over one another.

We still need environment sounds. All the maps sound DEAD.
