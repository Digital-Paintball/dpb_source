<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">sorry in advance for the informality of
following document.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none">Due to our
team's history of er, being slow workers shall we say, I felt it'd 
be a good idea to write up some guidelines that will speed the
content creation process along a tad.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none">I.<U>Use of
concept art</U></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none">	This is mainly
for the level designers, but also for modelers (if we end up having
to create some of our own guns, hoppers, etc.) and for anyone doing
other 2D art.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none">	We all know
what concept art is, and I see that most of us have pitched in a
level concept or two. This is good =). For level design especially,
posting a good concept and allowing discussion can create interesting
new additions/tweaks to the concept and inspire creativity and junk.
So, basically, we want to draw up a basic level design concept, toss
it around in IRC, and come to some decisions about it, such as... Is
it feasible? Will it add to the game in a significant way? Will it
present any significant technical challenges? Will it be fun and
balanced for both teams? Things like that. A five minute concept
sketch done in mspaint can eliminate hours wasted on a boring,
unbalanced, or useless level design. When a level comes out of the
concept art phase, we should know exactly how we want it to look and
feel, what special ideas it has (like norrington and the multi-arena
concept), etc. The process should then be down to overcoming any
technical issues (more on this later) and then just making the thing.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none">	For other 2D
art, posting concepts of, say, new skinning techniques or new site
designs, menu backgrounds, etc. before taking the time to create them
can save time as well. For example, I did a concept of a new plastic
texture i was working on, posted it in IRC, and found out it looked
too metallic. I had planned to use this texture on a new skin, but
now I know not to use it (or, rather, to use the version of it I
fixed =P). Saves a lot of time going back and redoing, say, five or
six skins that may have used that texture eh?</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none">	Anywho, I guess
thats the end of the whole concept art dealy.</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none">	Pre-planning is
necessary for everyone who's going to do artistic content.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none">	For level
designers, we may be doing things that you may be unfamiliar with, or
you may know of an area of your work that needs to be improved before
a concept level can be made. This is where pre planning comes in. If,
say, a map is supposed to have wind entities we've created, and you
dont know quite how these work, a good idea would be to make a small
map with all these entities set up in different fashions, so that you
can grasp more thoroughly the workings of said entity. Or if, for
example, you dont know how to do a 3D skybox, but the map concept
calls for one, you'd better learn how to do it ASAP. The idea is to
uncover and isolate any technical issue you may have while making the
map, and to work on that issue in little maps until its not an issue
any more =).</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none">	</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none">	For modelers,
skinners, and animators, we want to do some of the same things. For
example, if we're modeling a system-x NME or something with all sorts
of wonky holes and cuts and shapes and doodads, its a good idea to
try to make that body over, and over, and over again, until you've
got it correct. Making the whole gun only to find that you forgot to
add a certain part or that the body is shaped wrong, or something, is
a little disheartening and a big waste of time. For skinners,
skinning a whole marker only to learn you've messed up or forgotten
to do part of the body is also a big bag of suck, so dont do things
like that =) For animators, rigging and compiling a whole gun, then
learning that, say, its going to have more parts than previously
thought and needs to have an idle animation for a 2 finger trigger
and 1 finger trigger, rather than just a 1 finger trigger, that sucks
too. And we want to experience as little (figurative) sucking as
possible. <I>We all need to get together and decide what animations a
particular marker is going to need before its animated and compiled.
We also need to decide what upgrade parts markers will have before we
go modeling and skinning and compiling them. </I>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none">That's really
important, cause going back and redoing all the animations for a gun
because you didnt know you needed a bone somewhere, is not enjoyable.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none"><BR>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none">	For other 2d
artists, we dont wanna do things like make a nice, sexy background
for the game only to find out you cant read the menu text over it,
not that something like that would ever happen =P.</P>

	This is probably what will save us the most time when it comes to
artist/programmer interaction. Here, the idea is to just throw
something together (that works) in the shortest time possible, to let
our programmers get to work including it.

For level designers, this means making a box with all the code
dependent things we may be  using (wind, arenas, other shit i havent
thought of) so that we can verify that they do indeed work. Its no
use building a whole sexy map if it turns out some entity wasnt set
right and crashes the game, or something O.o (things like this have
happened to me..).  Then its just a matter of making the real deal
and adding in all the settings from the placeholder.</P>

For modelers, this means, rather than spend hours making a sexy new
marker, so that we can spend hours making sexy new animations, so
that our programmers have to wait all those hours before creating the
newest build of the game, we can make some boxes shit with the
correct subskins and subskin names, submodels, animations, etc and
toss it on SVN for the coders to work with until the real  deal is
finished. These placeholders need to have all the attributes the
finished product will have, other than the shape and all that.</P>

For animators, same deal, the model need not have sexy animations,
just animations different enough that we can see that the proper
animation plays at the proper time whilst we test in-game.</P>

For skinners and map texture artists, if we know we need to replace a
Valve texture we used, or we know that we want a certain texture
(that we dont have yet) to have a new surface property, then we can
just create some zonky texture and use that, so that all the other
settings can be tested (or in the case of the valve texture, so we
know to replace the damn thing ASAP)</P>

This section should be fairly short... basically, if you make
something you know is gonna be used a lot, make it a prefab (I.E.
Flag stations with the proper model and entities applied) and put it
on svn. If you create a base texture for a model, for the sake of
keeping things the same from model to model, upload it to svn so that
we all may use it. Having standard placeholder textures also saves
time so that each mapper, modeler, or what have you, doesnt have to
create his own.</P>

Another important bit. We all know that working on a map, skin,
model, what have you is pretty draining, and gets very boring after
oh.. an hour or so. In most departments, we have more than one person
doing each job. If you're tired of working on something, put it on
SVN, let everyone know that they're free to work on it, (since we
covered knowing exactly how things would be put together in the
concept and preplanning stages we shouldnt have any creative
conflicts), and go eat some ramen noodles or something. This is
easiest for our 2d artists, since mappers and modelers may not have
all the resources needed to complete something (though, in theory,
everything should be on svn). One skinner could start a skin, get
bored, another skinner could pick up and work on it some more, get
bored, etc. Again, <U>everything should be on SVN, even model
reference images, raw texture photos, everything.</U></P>
